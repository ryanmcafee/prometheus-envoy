# Enphase Envoy Golang Client

This is a prometheus collector for pulling metrics from an Envoy Enphase unit. The collector
utilizes the local interface exposed by the device rather than the Enlighten API. Enphase units
are embedded devices, so the collector is implemented as a proxy collector similar to the
snmp_exporter tool.
